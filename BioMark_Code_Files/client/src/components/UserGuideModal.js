              <li>
                <strong>Step 1: Loading the Demo Dataset</strong>
                <br />
                Navigate to the BioMark website.
                <br />
                On the homepage, you have two options: upload your own data with the "Browse" button or use the built-in demo data.
                <br />
                To follow along with this tutorial, select the "Use a Demo Dataset for Alzheimer's Disease" option.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Step 2: Configuring the Analysis Groups</strong>
                <br />
                In Step 3 of the tool, you need to select two key columns from your data.
                <br />
                First, select the column that specifies the status of your samples (e.g., patient or healthy). For our demo, this is the "Diagnosis" column.
                <br />
                Next, select the column that contains the unique ID for each sample.
                <br />
                In Step 4, you will see the distribution of patient groups. Choose the classes you want to compare. For this example, we select "AD" (Alzheimer's Disease) and "Control".
                <br />
                Click "Analyze" to proceed.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Step 3: Running Your First Analysis (SHAP)</strong>
                <br />
                In Step 5, choose your desired analysis. BioMark offers a wide array of methods, from differential analysis to clustering and classification. We will start with SHAP, a powerful machine-learning-based method.
                <br />
                In Step 6, exclude any non-numeric or irrelevant columns from the analysis (e.g., "Age", "Gender").
                <br />
                Click "Run Analysis" to start the process.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Step 4: Interpreting Results & Running a Second Analysis (ANOVA)</strong>
                <br />
                Once the analysis is complete, you can explore the interactive SHAP plots to understand the results. The Summary Plot gives a global overview of the most impactful biomarkers, while the Force Plot explains the model's reasoning for a single, specific sample.
                <br />
                To run a comparative analysis, click the "Perform another analysis" button.
                <br />
                This time, select a different method, such as ANOVA, and run the analysis again to get results from a traditional statistical perspective.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Step 5: Creating a Consolidated Biomarker List</strong>
                <br />
                Now that you have results from two different methods (SHAP and ANOVA), it's time to find the most reliable candidates.
                <br />
                Click the "Combine Biomarker List" button.
                <br />
                Select the classes you compared ("AD" and "Control").
                <br />
                BioMark will generate a consensus-based ranking, showing the most robust biomarkers that were identified as important across both methods, giving you higher confidence in your findings.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Step 6: Generating Your Final Report</strong>
                <br />
                Finally, click the "Generate Analysis Report" button to compile all your results into a single, professional document.
                <br />
                The downloadable PDF report is structured to be publication-ready. It strategically begins with your most critical finding—the consolidated biomarker list—and is followed by a detailed breakdown of all the plots from your individual analyses (Waterfall, Force, Summary, Heatmap, ANOVA, etc.).
